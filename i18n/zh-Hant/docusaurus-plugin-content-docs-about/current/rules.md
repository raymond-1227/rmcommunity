# 規則

閱讀我們 Subreddit、Discord 以及 Minecraft 伺服器的規則。

_免責聲明：我們與 realme 官方沒有任何關係，單純為使用者自行創立之社群，但我們的確有一群一樣的使用者與你討論。_

## Subreddit 規則

## Discord 伺服器規則

1. **提及** - You may ping staffs for an appropriate reason. *DO NOT* ping roles. Do not ping staffs for technical help, we do not represent realme employees, therefore we cannot provide technical helps but some options you may try. If you have problem verifying, DM @ModMail [=] instead of DM-ing mods.
2. **NSFW** - Do not use an offensive profile picture or username. 
3. **侮辱** - Do not excessively attack other members. Excessive and malicious use of expletives are forbidden. Especially to our staff members.

6. **肉搜** - Do not give out any personal information of anybody.
7. **廣告** - Do not ask for or try to sell products of any kind. Permission must be requested from a staff member and must be shown upon request. Posting your own content such as videos or photos YOU have created are allowed, just don't use it as a form of self promotion. Do not cause a nuisance in the community, repeated complaints from several members will lead to a moderation action.
8. **重複問題** - Do not ask the same question in multiple channels.
9. **離題** - Use the proper channels for discussion. (e.g. You may only discuss political topics in #politics)

11. **違法軟體** - We do not tolerate any promotion or links of illegal softwares.
12. **規則更新** - We update rules, and it is your responsibility to check them regularly. We do not accept appeals of "rules updated didn't know that it exists" or something related like that.
