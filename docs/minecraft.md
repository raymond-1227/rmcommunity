# Minecraft Server

Read about our community Minecraft server.

We have a Minecraft survival server that you can join and play with other members. The server was created as a joke from dumpy, formerly known as DumpyMC, but since Raymond built a realme logo in the server and it eventually became realmeMC ever since.

## Server IP

The server IP is `play.realmemc.gq`.

## Server Rules

We want to keep the survival server as anarchy as possible, but we still do not allow these actions:

1. No griefing.
2. No stealing.
3. No hacking.
5. No advertising.
6. No spamming.
7. No racism.
8. No sexism.

Failing to follow these rules will result in an appropriate punishment.
