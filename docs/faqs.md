# FAQs

Read the messages that we don't want to repeat again and again.

## Are there any realme staff in the Discord server?

There is no, absolute **0** realme staff here, so please stop pinging staff members about your device issues, we don't represent as realme official, we are here to help and keep the community moderated.

## OMG RESPOND TO MY MESSAGES NOW, you know what I'm leaving this server!!!

Please note that response to your question might be late as people that has the answer might be busy with their life, therefore please don't just leave the server after 5 mins waiting for response, time zones exist.

If you leave the server shortly after asking, you wasted your time asking the question here without waiting for an answer.

## Why can't I DM some mods?

You might notice you can't DM some of the staff members, they've simply disabled DMs coming from this server due to members constantly asking questions about realme tech / server related issues, which is technically rule 1. I don't like constantly putting out warns, timeouts, etc.. For these weird reasons, so please read the rules carefully, thank you.

This is why some of the staff members disabled their DMs. They get question unrelated to server security in their DMs, but instead device / server related issues. They are happy to help you out but not in their DMs. As a workaround, you can use **@ModMail** to report something related to server security (e.g. abuse), but DO NOT use ModMail for technical help.

## New system update! Is it safe to update my phone?

Stop asking if it's safe to update your phone. We just don't care about your device. Even you ask any staff members 10,000 times if you should update, we'll still tell you to do so.

realme is also one of the companies that has the slowest update rollout speed, so if you receive update, **just don't hesitate and UPDATE.** Also realme releases multiple phones per year, so not everyone knows if your device has bugs or issues, everyone suffers from software bugs, you're not the special one with a ton of gaming performance drop or fast draining batteries, literally a lot of people here does.

Consider using our device discussions to talk about your device issues, we are here to help you.

## How do you spell "realme", especially the capitalization?

realme mostly use "realme" without any capitalizations.
If you're talking about "Realme" or "RealMe", then that's their registered company name "RealMe Chongqing Mobile Telecommunications Corp. Ltd." (or known as「深圳市锐尔觅移动通信有限公司」and「RealMe重庆移动通信有限公司」)
