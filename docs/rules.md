# Rules

Read the rules of the subreddit and our Discord server.

_Disclaimer: we do not represent as realme company's community, but we do have a group of people here to discuss with._

## Subreddit Rules

1. **Common courtesy** - Here are some courtesies you should follow.
   - No offensive or low-effort comments.
   - Do not be rude to any other user. Be respectful, or you may be banned.
   - Do not use hate speech of any kind.
   - Do not be disrespectful towards another for their personal choices (excessive fanboyism).
   - Do not accuse others of being "paid shills."
   - Do not post low-effort/circlejerky comments.
2. **Check for duplicates** - Do a search before you post to see if someone's already mentioned your issue. If so, comment on that post instead.
3. **No Soliciting Votes or Misleading Content** - Sensationalized or misleading content will be removed (at mod discretion). No soliciting votes (e.g. "upvote this")!
