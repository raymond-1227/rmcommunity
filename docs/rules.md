# Rules

Read the rules of the subreddit and our Discord server.

_Disclaimer: we do not represent as realme company's community, but we do have a group of people here to discuss with._

## Subreddit Rules

1. **Common courtesy** - Here are some courtesies you should follow.
   - No offensive or low-effort comments.
   - Do not be rude to any other user. Be respectful, or you may be banned.
   - Do not use hate speech of any kind.
   - Do not be disrespectful towards another for their personal choices (excessive fanboyism).
   - Do not accuse others of being "paid shills."
   - Do not post low-effort/circlejerky comments.
2. **Check for duplicates** - Do a search before you post to see if someone's already mentioned your issue. If so, comment on that post instead.
3. **No Soliciting Votes or Misleading Content** - Sensationalized or misleading content will be removed (at mod discretion). No soliciting votes (e.g. "upvote this")!
4. **Off Topic** - All posts to [r/realme](https://www.reddit.com/r/Realme) must be related to Realme in some direct way. Posts not related to realme or the realme ecosystem will be removed.
5. **No Referral Links** - Posts that contain referral/affiliate links will be removed on sight
6. **No Spamming** - Posting low-quality blog post or from non-authentic source is prohibited. This includes repetitive updates about new OTA updates, patches, etc.
7. **English Submissions Only** - Since this is a global realme community, we only accept English submissions. Submissions in any non-English language will be removed at mods discretion.


## Discord Rules

1. **Pings** - You may ping staffs for an appropriate reason. *DO NOT* ping roles. Do not ping staffs for technical help, we do not represent realme employees, therefore we cannot provide technical helps but some options you may try. If you have problem verifying, DM @ModMail [=] instead of DM-ing mods.
2. **NSFW** - Do not use an offensive profile picture or username. 
3. **Insults** - Do not excessively attack other members. Excessive and malicious use of expletives are forbidden. Especially to our staff members.
4. **Spam** - Do not spam messages in channels, nor acting stupid (e.g. ***YELLING*** in voice channels)
5. **Impersonation** - Do not pretend to be another person. 
6. **Doxxing** - Do not give out any personal information of anybody.
7. **Advertisements** - Do not ask for or try to sell products of any kind. Permission must be requested from a staff member and must be shown upon request. Posting your own content such as videos or photos YOU have created are allowed, just don't use it as a form of self promotion. Do not cause a nuisance in the community, repeated complaints from several members will lead to a moderation action.
8. **Repetitive Question** - Do not ask the same question in multiple channels.
9. **Bot Abuse** - Unless it fits within the conversation of the channel, use bot commands in the #bot-spam channel.
10. **Illegal Software** - We do not tolerate any promotion or links of illegal softwares.
11. **Rule Updates** - We update rules, and it is your responsibility to check them regularly. We do not accept appeals of "rules updated didn't know that it exists" or something related like that.
12. **Use English** - We moderate the community in English, please refrain from using languages outside English.
13. **We consider Discord ToS / Community Guidelines** - https://discord.com/terms/ / https://discord.com/guidelines/
14. **Other** - Just because something isn't mentioned here, does not mean that it's allowed. Staff members have the rights to decide what is and what is not appropriate.
